# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marc Julian Schwarz and currently I am studying Data Science at the Friedrich-Alexander-University in Erlangen. 
I love coding that's why I will share some of my projects here. Of course I also enjoy everything related to Data Science like Machine Learning, data visualizations, Deep Learning and math.
Other interests are spaceflight (especially developements at SpaceX) and the medical applications of Data Science.

## Projects:

### Telekom Widget:
The <a href="">Telekom widget</a> shows information about your current data usage on your homescreen (iOS 14).
All features are listed in the <a href"">README file</a>. 

### Telekom Module:
To easily implement data from the Telekom API, I created a Javascript module which can be used in your own projects. 
It preprocesses the API data, automatically stores it and synchronizes it over iCloud. For more information and instructions on how to use it can be found <a href="">here</a>.

Currently both the Telekom widget and module only support German Telekom contracts. This is the reason why the README files are all in german language.
