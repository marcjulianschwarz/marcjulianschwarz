# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marc Julian Schwarz and currently I am studying Data Science at the Friedrich-Alexander-University in Erlangen. 
I love coding that's why I will share some of my projects here. Of course I also enjoy everything related to Data Science like Machine Learning, data visualizations, Deep Learning and math. (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/marcjulian">My Kaggle account</a>)
Other interests are spaceflight (especially developements at SpaceX) and the medical applications of Data Science.

## Projects:
### Scriptable iOS Widgets: (<a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/scriptable-widgets">-> here</a>)
A small collection of my JavaScript scripts which can be used to create both beautiful and useful widget for iOS 14. All widgets are free to use and can be changed to your liking. In the general <a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/scriptable-widgets">README file</a> you will find instructions on how to use the scripts with the <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> app.

### Telekom Module:
To easily implement data from the Telekom API, I created a Javascript module which can be used in your own (Scriptable) projects. 
It preprocesses the API data, automatically stores it and synchronizes it over iCloud. More information and instructions on how to use it can be found <a href="https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/telekom-data-usage-widget/tree/main/telekom-module">here</a>.

Currently both the Telekom widget and module only support German Telekom contracts. This is the reason why their README files are all in german language.
