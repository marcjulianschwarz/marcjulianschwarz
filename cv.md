## Professional Work

##### Software Engineer / Data Scientist - AHEAD Automotive GmbH - 2024-Today
Hamburg, Germany

Architected and implemented most of our TypeScript backend and other services for our web app Qira.

- The **complete pipeline** from user query to answer: Preprocessing, chat memory management, tool selection, tool execution, result formatting, retry loops and detailed error handling
- An entire suite of **LLM tools** that perform search (semantic, bm25, fuzzy, hybrid approaches) across multiple data sources, powering the Qira answering system
- Integration of four API clients to fetch OE (Original Equipment) data
- An **automated evaluation system** to detect quality and performance regressions on commit and branch levels. Quality and performance improvements are tracked in live dashboards
- Extensive **observability platform** by tracing every step of the Qira system with OpenTelemetry, using semantic conventions to display results in Phoenix. This allows us to have a completely transparent look into the live operation of Qira, simplifying debugging and allowing cost estimations for token generations
- Azure, Ollama and HuggingFace embedding and LLM services for efficient semantic similarity search and text generation
- Making the app **production ready** with maintainable structured logging, error handling and extensive unit/e2e testing systems based on Sentry, neverthrow and vitest
- Maintaining our **server infrastructure** with typical CI/CD workflows, automated unit/e2e tests and deployments on various stages using Docker and nginx for web hosting
- **Technical documentation** of all software components
- Support in product management by steering the product development with concrete proposals
- Some Angular & Tailwind frontend work


##### Data Scientist - DATEV eG - 2022-2024
Nuremberg, Germany

Implemented and evaluated data science-related proofs of concept in the AI Office team.

- Evaluation of a PII (Personally Identifiable Information) identification procedure based on a NER (Named Entity Recognition) Ensemble
- **Semantics-preserving anonymization** of PIIs with subsequent re-identification for use with LLMs
- **Process mining** on legal documents  
- Record linkage for legal documents  
- MIP (Mixed-Integer Program) optimization for optimal employee calendar assignments  
- Assistance in implementing a **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system** for an intelligent chatbot on guideline documents
- RAG on video transcripts with video citations
- Bachelor's thesis "Mainframe Meets AI - Improving Legacy Code Generation Through Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models"
- **Topic classification** of scientific texts in the Franconian Data Science League Hackathon  
- Presentation at an employee meeting on the topic of ChatGPT and AI for DATEV  
- Development of several Streamlit web applications for various proofs of concept and internal dashboards  
- Support in many other machine learning projects


##### Research Assistant - Fraunhofer IIS - 2021-2022
Nuremberg, Germany

Worked in the "Machine Learning and Validation" research group.

- Motion capture data analysis
- Preprocessing and evaluation of the measurement data obtained from a motion capture system 
- Conducted literature research in the area of IMU in-field calibration and **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithm** benchmarking 
- Several data analysis and preprocessing tasks, resulting in processed data that I made accessible via a **Flask API** and an accompanying web application
- Custom Streamlit component using **TypeScript and React** to display the data in a use-case specific dashboard view


## Education

##### Bachelor of Science - Data Science - 2020-2024
Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen Nürnberg

- Bachelor's thesis "Mainframe Meets AI - Improving Legacy Code Generation Through Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models"
- Used a Kubernetes cluster with four H100 GPUs to fine-tune a large language model on instruction-formatted legacy mainframe code to improve code generation performance for several tasks

##### General University Entrance Qualification - 2012-2020
Gymnasium Stein
